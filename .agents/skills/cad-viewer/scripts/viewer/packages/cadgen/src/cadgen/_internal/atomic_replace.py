"""The one atomic rename every artifact writer uses.

Every cached artifact is written to a temp file and renamed into place, so a reader never sees
a half-written payload. On a Windows SMB share that rename is not reliably atomic-and-instant:
the redirector can still hold the handle Python just closed, and the rename loses with
``WinError 32`` (ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION, "file is being used by another process"). Under a
parallel component build it happens reliably -- see issue #241, where 8 workers failed every
time on a NAS and ``CADGEN_COMPONENT_WORKERS=1`` succeeded.

The remedy is a short bounded retry, and the reason it lives here rather than at each writer is
that there are seven of these renames in a build's write path. Hardening one moves the failure
to the next: the reporter's traceback caught the GLB writer's inner rename, with the outer
component rename one frame away.

Deliberately narrow:

* only ``WinError 32`` retries. A denial (5) or a missing directory is a real error and must
  surface at once, not 350 ms later.
* the attribute does not exist off Windows, so this is exactly ``os.replace`` on POSIX.
* five attempts over 750 ms, then the original error propagates. A rename that cannot win in
  that window is not a deferred close, and a build that hangs retrying is worse than one that
  says what happened.

The window is sized for the TAIL, not the median, and that distinction is the whole of issue
#274. 350 ms looked generous per rename and was: measured on a Synology SMB share over two
84-component builds, 126 of 168 renames blocked at all, median 31 ms, p90 118 ms -- and max
389 ms, just past the old budget. But the budget is spent per rename while the BUILD only
succeeds if every rename wins, and a large assembly draws from that distribution a hundred-odd
times. At 168 renames even a 1% per-rename loss rate leaves roughly a 1-in-5 chance of a clean
build, which is what the reporter saw: 1 of 3 runs completing, each failure on a different
component. Widening costs the common case nothing, because a 31 ms median still wins on the
first or second retry.
